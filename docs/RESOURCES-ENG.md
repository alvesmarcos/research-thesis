## Automated Machine Learning

This is a brief overview about AutoML. At the beginning I will focus on explore the Automating Feature Engineering (AFE) in order to build a Framework to automated some steps of the pipeline.

Machine Learning (ML) has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human machine learning experts to perform the following tasks:

-   **Preprocess the data**,
-   **Select appropriate features**,
-   Select an appropriate model family,
-   **Optimize model hyperparameters**,
-   Postprocess machine learning models,
-   Critically analyze the results obtained.

AutoML is defined as a combination of automation and machine learning. In a word, AutoML can be understood to involve the automated construction of a machine-learning pipeline on a limited computational budget.
