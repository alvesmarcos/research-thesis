# Stones

A minimalist Automated Machine Learning tool to optimize Neural Networks Models pipeline. Each step of the pipeline is named like one of **Infinity Stones**, if you do not know what I am talk about please click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_Gems).

## Automated Machine Learning

This is a brief overview about AutoML. At the beginning I will focus on explore the Automating Feature Engineering (AFE) in order to build a Framework to automated some steps of the pipeline.

Machine Learning (ML) has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human machine learning experts to perform the following tasks:

-   **Preprocess the data**,
-   **Select appropriate features**,
-   Select an appropriate model family,
-   Optimize model hyperparameters,
-   Postprocess machine learning models,
-   Critically analyze the results obtained.

AutoML is defined as a combination of automation and machine learning. In a word, AutoML can be understood to involve the automated construction of a machine-learning pipeline on a limited computational budget.
